1.  Introduction

   This document describes how a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Conference Server can be used to realize a Publish/Subscribe (PubSub)
   broker to distribute non-audiovisual data.

   One main advantage of the solution is the possibility to use existing
   RTP-based audiovisual conferencing infrastructure and protocols to
   realize data distributing using the Publish/Subscribe traffic
   pattern, instead of using dedicated Publish/Subscribe infrastructure
   and protocols.

   NOTE: SIP Conference servers might behave differently depending on
   configuration, profiles etc.  The procedures in this document are
   based on a generic understanding of how conference servers behave.

   NOTE: The examples in this document use the RTP T.140 real-time text
   (RTT) payload format to transport the payload data, and SenML to
   structure and encode the payload data.  Other mechanisms can also be
   used.
